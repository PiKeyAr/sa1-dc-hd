# Sonic Adventure DC-HD
This repository is primarily meant for research and discussion related to Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast) and emulating it on PC with various patches and enhancements. Eventually it may host a script to create a CDI image containing a patched/enhanced version of the game to be used on emulators.

The following goals are considered for this project:

**Priority fixes**
1) A proper widescreen patch without clipping or HUD stretching.
2) 60 FPS patch + fixes for glitches that happen when the game is running at 60 FPS.
3) Fix for "controller drift" that happens when playing with the keyboard or a controller with a less sensitive analog stick than the original DC one.
4) Skippable FMVs.
5) A code or an ingame toggle to disable cutscenes.

**Enhancements and other fixes**
1) A texture pack with HD menu textures based on [SADX HD GUI 2](https://github.com/PiKeyAr/sadx-hd-gui).
2) Restoration of unused but functional SET objects similar to the "Extra SET layouts" option in the [Fixes, Adds and Beta Restores mod](https://github.com/supercoolsonic/Fixes_Adds_BetaRestores).
3) Increased level and object draw distance.
4) Various minor fixes related to object placement, missing collision etc. that involve small edits to the landtable or SET items.
5) Better quality FMVs.

At the moment this repository is only used to share information. Ready-made downloads and feature requests are unavailable.

Unless specified otherwise, all patches and codes shared here are for Sonic Adventure 1.005 (US, animated title screen).
