# Sonic Adventure DC-HD

Version 31/08/2021

This repository hosts a program that applies a set of patches to the Dreamcast version of Sonic Adventure to introduce various fixes and improvements.

The patched version is meant to be run on the [flycast emulator](https://flyinghead.github.io/flycast-builds), although everything other than 60 FPS and widescreen hacks will also work on other emulators and original Dreamcast hardware.

**LIST OF PATCHES**

- The game runs at 60 FPS during gameplay without framerate-related glitches (hopefully).
- Widescreen hack without model clipping or HUD stretching.
- All FMVs can be skipped by pressing Start.
- Cutscenes can be skipped by holding B before a cutscene loads.
- If you cannot run in a straight line with your controller/keyboard, there is a patch to fix that.
- Less choppy ocean in Emerald Coast (similar to Dreamcast Conversion for SADX PC).
- Some levels have better level draw distance.


All patches are optional and can be toggled individually before building the image.


**PREREQUISITES**

- Sonic Adventure US 1.005 GDI image.
- [flycast](https://flyinghead.github.io/flycast-builds/) or reicast to play the game.

**As of August 2021, only flycast is compatible with the 60 FPS code and the current implementation of the widescreen hack.**
