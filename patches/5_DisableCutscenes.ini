Name=Disable all cutscenes
Description=This code removes all cutscenes from the game similar to a code available in SADX Mod Loader. This does NOT make cutscenes skippable, it completely disables them!\n\nThis option is also available as a cheat code which you can toggle without patching the image. If you want to use the cheat code, do not enable this patch.\n\nKnown issues:\nSometimes you will see a character appear in a stage briefly before the game proceeds to the next scene.
